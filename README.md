# Sleep-Disorder-EDA-Analysis
# ðŸ’¤ Sleep Disorder EDA Analysis

This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore and identify key patterns, correlations, and insights related to **sleep disorders** such as **Insomnia** and **Sleep Apnea** using real-world lifestyle, psychological, and biological data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Sleep disorders are rising due to stressful routines and unhealthy lifestyles.  
This project analyzes various factors like stress level, BMI, age, heart rate, sleep duration, and occupation to identify early signs and high-risk groups for sleep disorders.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze the impact of **Age**, **Gender**, and **Occupation**
- Explore how **Stress**, **BMI**, and **Heart Rate** relate to sleep health
- Understand how **Sleep Duration** and **Quality** differ by disorder type
- Use **Correlation heatmap** to find key predictors for Insomnia & Apnea

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Visualizations

- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Boxplots & Violin plots for stress, BP, and BMI
- Pairplots, Countplots by occupation and gender
- Stacked bar plots of sleep disorder vs demographics

---

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

- **Stress and poor sleep quality** have the strongest negative correlation with sleep disorders.
- **Age, BMI, and heart rate** moderately increase sleep disorder risk.
- **Insomnia** is common in stressed, middle-aged individuals.
- **Sleep Apnea** affects older, overweight peopleâ€”especially females.
- Jobs like **Nursing**, **Sales**, and **IT** are highly impacted.

## ðŸ’Š Prescriptions

- Promote stress-reduction techniques (yoga, therapy)
- Encourage regular sleep schedules and active lifestyle
- Screen high-risk groups (obese, hypertensive, elderly)

## ðŸ’¡ Real-World Use Case

IT employees, nurses, and sales professionals are at high risk due to stress, sedentary work, and long shifts.  
This project helps **healthcare professionals**, **startups**, or **HR teams** detect risk early and promote better sleep culture.
